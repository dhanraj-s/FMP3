# FMP3
A simple mp3 player using the FMOD Core API

You need to have the FMOD library installed on your system.
Make sure all the FMOD headers are inside a directory named 'FMOD' in your include path.
Use `make` to build and `make clean` to clean up *.o files.

To use the program, make sure the `.mp3` file you want to play is in the same directory as the executable.

To start the program, type the following command into the terminal:
`./fmp3 <filename>`
Making sure your working directory is the same as the one in which the executable is located.
